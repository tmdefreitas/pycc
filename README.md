# pycc
Python Code Compare -- Compare python code similarity

### Ideas
- Use sequence alignment of source code tokens to find code similarity
- Substitution matrices based on common refactoring technicques
- BLAST-style code search
- Generate code using genetic algorithms based on substitution matrices
